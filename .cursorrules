# Cursor AI Rules for Base-App

## Reporting Structure

When creating or updating reports in `docs/reports/`, follow these rules:

### Directory Structure

Reports must be placed in the correct category directory:
- `docs/reports/audits/security/` - Security audits
- `docs/reports/technical/` - Technical documentation
- `docs/reports/implementation/` - Implementation status
- `docs/reports/implementation/stages/` - Development stage reports
- `docs/reports/implementation/milestones/` - Milestone reports
- `docs/reports/analysis/` - Code analysis, performance
- `docs/reports/services/{service}/` - Service-specific reports (auth, theme, webhook)
- `docs/reports/planning/` - Roadmaps, planning docs

### Naming Conventions

- **Format**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Pattern**: `{category}-{descriptive-name}.md`
- **Service Reports**: `{service-name}-{report-type}.md`
- **No dates in filenames**: Dates belong in frontmatter, not filename
- **No underscores**: Use hyphens instead

**Examples:**
- ✅ `authentication-security-audit.md`
- ✅ `api-performance-analysis.md`
- ✅ `v1-implementation-complete.md`
- ✅ `services/auth/jwt-implementation-complete.md`
- ❌ `Authentication_Security_Audit.md` (wrong case, wrong separator)
- ❌ `api-performance-analysis-2025-01-15.md` (date in filename)

### Report Template

Every report must include this frontmatter:

```markdown
# Report Title

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Complete | In Progress | Draft  
**Category:** Audit | Technical | Implementation | Analysis | Planning  
**Service:** auth | theme | webhook | all  
**Author:** [Optional]

## Summary

Brief summary of the report (2-3 sentences).

## Details

Detailed content of the report...

## Findings / Results

Key findings, results, or outcomes...

## Recommendations

Action items or next steps...

## Related Reports

- [Related Report Name](./path/to/report.md)
```

### Required Frontmatter Fields

- **Date**: Report date (format: Month YYYY)
- **Status**: Current status (Complete, In Progress, Draft)
- **Category**: Report category (Audit, Technical, Implementation, Analysis, Planning)
- **Service**: Service name if applicable (auth, theme, webhook, all)

### Validation

Before committing reports:
1. Run `./scripts/validate-reports.sh` to validate structure
2. Ensure kebab-case naming
3. Verify frontmatter fields are present
4. Check file is in correct directory

### Service-Specific Reports

When creating service reports:
- Place in `docs/reports/services/{service-name}/`
- Use naming: `{service-name}-{report-type}.md`
- Examples:
  - `services/auth/authentication-implementation-complete.md`
  - `services/theme/theme-service-complete.md`
  - `services/webhook/webhook-reliability-report.md`

### When to Create Reports

- **After Major Milestones** → `implementation/milestones/`
- **After Security Reviews** → `audits/security/`
- **After Performance Testing** → `analysis/`
- **After Service Completion** → `services/{service}/`
- **After Architecture Changes** → `technical/`
- **During Planning** → `planning/`

## Code Style

- Follow Go best practices
- Use structured logging (Zap)
- Implement proper error handling
- Write tests for new features

## Documentation

- Keep user-facing docs in root (`README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `TESTING.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Technical reports go in `docs/reports/`
- Archive temporary files in `docs/archive/`
